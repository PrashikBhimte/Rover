# Rover

Project Summary:
    The project mini Mars rover had an aim to build a bot that would collect different data using different sensors. This Data would display on 
the web application. Also using that web application we would control the bot movements. Its' primary aim was to make a small version of the actual 
Mars rover. This project's main purpose is to learn different stacks. The bot would explore the area that is unexplored to human and by its sensors,
it determine whether the area is safe for humans or not. Our bot was able to collect the data from four sensors (2 IR, ultrasonic, and moisture sensors)
and we successfully display that live data on our own made web application also we were able to control its movements. For the main control, we
use the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Python language for the project. For the web application, we use Python flask to create a server.
